The Snow Globe code example from Take My Money by
Noel Rappin, published by The Pragmatic Programmers.

This is the code from the connect/02 code base, upgraded to Rails 5.1

I have no idea whether any of this works correctly, I'll be looking
through the book to understand the code.

Current Status:

* Ruby 2.4.1

* Commentary (if any) will be on my [blog](http://www.thecwlzone.com/blog/)
