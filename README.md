The Snow Globe code example from Take My Money by
Noel Rappin, published by The Pragmatic Programmers.

This is the code from the connect/02 code base, upgraded to Rails 5.1

The app should start up and show the root URL.
Logins and authentication should be working.
Some tests fail due to stale account information.

Current Status:

* Rails 5.1.4

* Ruby 2.4.1

* Commentary (if any) will be on my [blog](http://www.thecwlzone.com/blog/)
