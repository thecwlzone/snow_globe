The Snow Globe code example from Take My Money by
Noel Rappin, published by The Pragmatic Programmers.

This is the code from the connect/02 code base, upgraded to Rails 5.2
and Ruby 2.7.0

The app needs some work, lots of Ruby 2.7 warnings on startup,
and the server doesn't start.

Current Status:

* Rails 5.2.2

* Ruby 2.7.0

* Commentary (if any) will be on my [blog](http://www.thecwlzone.com/blog/)
